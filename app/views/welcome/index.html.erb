						<p class=" font-xl">Welcome to <strong>Access Management</strong> web application!</p>
						<p class=" font-lg"> The application is specially designed for administrators and is supposed to ease their work. It's a tool for controlling access to resources based on a specific user or user group. This is enabled with a graph editor which allows the administrator to define premissions through specially designed GUI. The editor relies on D3 JavaScript library for better experience. The application also provides a convenient way of testing the requests with embedded test services.</p>
